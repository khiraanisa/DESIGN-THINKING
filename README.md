## Overview 
EverCare is a mobile application designed to help elderly individuals manage their health effortlessly. As people age, they often face challenges like forgetting to take medications, tracking vital signs, and scheduling doctor appointments. EverCare provides a simple, voice-assisted, and intuitive solution to help seniors stay on top of their health.

With easy-to-use features like medication reminders, health records, emergency alerts, and doctor appointment scheduling, EverCare ensures that elderly users receive the care they need. By incorporating large text, minimal navigation steps, and voice commands, the app is accessible even for non-tech-savvy users. Built using a design thinking approach, EverCare prioritizes usability, accessibility, and real-world needs, making healthcare management stress-free and reliable for elderly people.
